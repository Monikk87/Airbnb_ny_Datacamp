# Airbnb_NY_Datacamp

### Analyse Airbnb listings trends in New York at 2019 in a Datacamp project as part of a Data Scientist track learning

### Problem description:
There are many Airbnb listings in New York City to meet the high demand for temporary lodging for travelers, which can be anywhere between a few nights to many months. In this project, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market by combining data from multiple file types like .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx.

### Data 
The data was provided in Datacamp for the year of 2019. The data is split through 3 files and formats .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx.

See the data sets and description in the data_sets file

### Motivation
In this project I answered Datacamp's questions and dug further to answer my own questions. I wanted to practice:
- Reading data from different files types
- Merging data
- Cleaning data and preparing it for analysis
- Visualising data with Plotly and Seaborn
- Hypothesis testing
- Pulling geographical data from the web and visualising it

### Thought process
- I read the files into dataframes
- I merged all dataframes based on the columns explanation given in the exercise (see data sets file)
- I conducted exploratory analysis
- I cleaned the data by changing columns types and performing other manipulations
- I visualised data with Plotly and Seaborn
- I conducted hypthesis testing
- I pulled data from Google API (used ChatGpt code)
- I ploted the geo data with Plotly
